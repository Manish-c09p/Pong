# Pong ðŸŽ®
A simple **Pong game clone** built using **C++**.  
This project helped me practice **game logic, loops, and collision detection** while improving my understanding of C++ fundamentals.

## Features
- Two-player Pong game ðŸŽ¾
- Ball movement and collision detection
- Score tracking for both players
- Minimal and beginner-friendly implementation

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Libraries:** Raylib

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manish-c09p/Pong.git
2. Clone this repository:
   cd Pong

3. Clone this repository:
   g++ pong.cpp -o pong

4. Run the Game:
   ./pong

## Learning Outcome

- Implementing game loops and collision detection
- Applying conditions for scoring and paddle control
- Basics of structuring a C++ project
- Debugging logical and runtime errors in small-scale projects
